# wordguess-cli
This command line game is similar to Hangman. A word is selected at random from a list of stored words. Letters of the word are marked with "_" until guessed. Once a letter is correctly guessed, the letter appears in the word. The user has 10 chances to guess the word. Once the word is correctly guessed or there are no chances left, the round is over and a new round begins.
